        <p class="card-text"> Welcome to the last part of our blog .In here we put forth our reflections and journey of this course .This part would also include our lessons learnt, knowledge gained and the whole experience of the  course.</p>

        <!-- Blog Post -->




		<!-- First Part of the blog -->

        <div class="card mb-4">
          <h2 class="card-title">Technical challenges our team encountered</h2>
          <img class="card-img-top" src="images/challenges.jpg" alt="Challenges">
          <div class="card-body">

			<p class="card-text"> We are  a team with diverse members and different backgrounds . While it was a great chance for collaboration ,it brought its own set of challenges.</p>
<li>Prior to this course , none of us were familiar with Andriod studio and programming in Java.So we had to learn basic OOPS concepts before we start to understand Java code and program in it .</li>
<li>We faced a lot of issues while merging the code as each one of us followed there own conventions in coding . This issue got resolved after we agreed upon one coding convention </li>
<li>There was also a bit of ambiguity in understanding the user requirements since each of us interpreted it as per their understanding .This got resolved through successive meetings in the übungs </li>

<h4 class ="card-title">Generic challenges faced working together </h4>
    <img class="card-img-top" src="images/team_discussion.jpg" alt="team_discussion">
    <li>Time management: was a major issue while working together . As if one person delays it due to some reason , the dependent gets delayed and so on .</li>
    <li>Conflicting opinions : There was always discussion and debates on how a particular thing needs to be done.</li>
    <li>Dividing tasks : Who does the blog part , who does the coding for a particular milestone or presentation was something we had issues with as different tasks had different difficulty levels .The person who had taken up a difficult task earleir wanted to do something light and it was not the same vice versa </li>
<li> Common time slots : As we are from different semesters , finding a common time slot suitable for all was a task in itslef and also we found it daunting to handle unforeseen circumstances like when one our members became sick and was hospitalised. </li>
            </div>

            <h2 class="card-title">Benefits of working together as a team :</h2>
			<p class="card-text"> We had a lot of benefits working together as a team .</p>

<li>Github and Slack : Along with Android Studio , we also got hands on expericence with Github and  Slack .</li>
<li>Team management and Leadership skills : Management a team can be a daunting task and we got to experience it through the different sprints and working in an agile fashion .</li>
<li>Communication : One major takeaway from this is that effective communication is of utmost importance. </li>
<li> Learning and Teaching others can also be another good takeaway.</li>
</br></br>

  <h3 class="card-title">How the course met our expectations :</h3>
      <img class="card-img-top" src="images/feedback_form.jpg" alt="feedback">
