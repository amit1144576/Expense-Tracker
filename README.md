# ISEE2019 Code Pros

## About this repository

It is about more than just programming – software development:

Within this project, we cover requirements engineering, system design, programming, testing and quality assurance plus a dynamic team management.

Using open source, Android Studio - Java programming language, we are going to buid this app as part of ISEE module in OVGU in the duration of one semester "summer term 2019".


## A little about the project…

Below is a brief description of what we meant to do.

"Spending money is easy, taking control over it is most of the times a challenge. This App should be designed and implemented to help with the latter. It should allow users to (manually) specify what they spent their money for. Given some income (that can be specified as well), it allows you at any time to double-check whether your money is in balance or not. Moreover, maintaining a history of your inputs allows to observe how your behavior has changed, which is especially useful to get rid of imbalances. Also, some statistics should be show virtually to the user."
